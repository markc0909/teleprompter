# Teleprompter

A simple, one-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript **teleprompter app** designed for presenters who want to follow a script while looking at their screen – perfect for **online presentations**, **webinars**, or **recorded videos**.

## 🎯 Features

- 📜 Supports **Markdown formatting** (with built-in formatting guide)
- 🚦 Adjustable **scroll speed** (Slow to Very Fast)
- ▶️ **Start**, ⏸️ **Stop**, 🔄 **Reset**, and 🔁 **Resume** controls
- 📏 Red guide line for eye-tracking assistance
- 🧼 Clean, distraction-free teleprompter window

## 🖼️ Demo

Paste your script in Markdown format, select a scroll speed, and hit "Start". A red line helps you keep your eyes aligned with the scrolling text.

Example usage:
- Online speaking engagements
- Practicing speeches
- Voiceover or screen recording narration

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Paste your script into the textarea.
4. Click **Start** and begin reading.
5. Use **Stop**, **Reset**, or **Resume** as needed.

## 📄 Markdown Help

Click the `(what's that?)` link next to the input field to view a quick Markdown formatting guide. Use headings, bullet points, bold, italics, and even images or code blocks if you want to jazz things up.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) for Markdown rendering
- No build tools or dependencies – runs in-browser

## 📦 Deployment

This is a static app – you can deploy it easily via:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Or just run it locally

## 🚧 Notes

This app does not currently support saving multiple script or sharing settings.  It will persist your current / last script to browser storage in case of a crash, otherwise I recommend Notion or another markdown editor. 
It’s meant to be lightweight and offline-friendly. Contributions welcome if you'd like to expand it!
